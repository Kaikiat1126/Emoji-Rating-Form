A Dynamic Emoji Rating Form Built with React and Less

This is a user interface component that allows users to rate a product, service or any other entity using emojis instead of traditional star ratings. The form would be dynamic in the sense that it would update in real-time based on user input, without the need for a page refresh. The form would consist of a set of emojis, each representing a different rating value. The user would be able to select an emoji by clicking on it, and the form would then display the selected rating. Additionally, the form would also include logic to handle hover effects and display feedback based on the user's selection. The React component could also be styled with CSS to match the look and feel of the website or application.
